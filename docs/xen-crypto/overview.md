# Xen Crypto Overview

Xen Crypto is an innovative ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to build a community through social mining.

## Key Features of Xen Crypto

- **Consensus Mechanism**: Utilizes Proof-of-Participation (PoP), different from traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems.
- **Ownership and Minting**: Grants ownership rights through participation in the creation of XEN and holding coins via self-custody.
- **Tokenomics**: Disinflationary nature due to increasing difficulty in minting new tokens as more participants join. No cap on the number of tokens.

## Launch and Development

- **Inception**: Launched in October 2022 by the Fair Crypto Foundation.
- **Creator**: Jack Levin, a former Google executive.
- **Impact on Ethereum**: Notable usage of Ethereum's block size post-Ethereum Merge, influencing ETH gas prices and supply.

## Trading and Usage

- **Trading Platforms**: Listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges, available for trading.
- **Functionality**: Similar to ERC20 tokens, allowing trading of other cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
- **Ecosystem Connectivity**: Connects to ecosystems like Uniswap for liquidity pools and limit orders.

## Vision and Mission

- **Community-Driven**: Aims to be an encrypted asset driven by community values like decentralization and transparency.
- **Accessibility**: Provides an accessible and cost-effective entry into the crypto world through its unique economic model.
