# Xen Stake NFT

Xen Stake NFT is a part of the XEN Crypto ecosystem, offering a unique approach to staking cryptocurrencies.

## Key Features

- **Staking as NFT**: Enables users to stake XEN tokens and receive an NFT as proof of stake.
- **Tradeable Stakes**: These NFTs can be traded on secondary markets, making the stakes portable.
- **Token Burning**: Staking involves burning XEN tokens for a period ranging from 1 to 1000 days.
- **Adjustable APY**: Starting APY of 20%, decreasing over time to a fixed rate of 2%.
- **Rarity Score**: Includes unique scoring based on prime numbers and Fibonacci sequences for added value.

## Process

- **Staking Mechanism**: When tokens are staked, they are permanently removed from the supply and minted anew upon unstaking.
- **Rarity Factors**: The rarity score is determined by the token ID and block number's mathematical properties.

## Implications

- **Enhanced Value**: The rarity aspect potentially increases the value of certain NFTs within the system.
- **Participation in Projects**: These NFTs may have additional power in various projects due to their rarity scores.
