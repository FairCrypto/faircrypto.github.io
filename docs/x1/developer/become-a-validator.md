# Become a Validator

Validator nodes are a crucial component of the X1 network.
These nodes operate as full nodes and contribute to consensus,
thereby enhancing the network's security and facilitating the creation of new blocks.

::: info Requirements

- Minimum state requirement: 100,000 XN
- Maximum stake: 15x the minimum state amount
- Earn staking rewards and a 15% fee on delegator's rewards
- Minimum hardware requirements: AWS T2.large EC2 (or equivalent) and at least
  800GB of Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage (or equivalent).
:::

## Step 1: Run A Full Node

Following the [Developer Docs](../developer) guide to install and run a full node. 

::: tip 
Allow the node to **fully sync** before moving forward.
:::

## Step 2: Fund a wallet

Fund a wallet with enough XN to become a validator. 

At the time of writing, you need at least 100,000 XN (plus gas fees) to become a validator.

::: warning
We highly recommend using a hardware wallet to keep your funds secure.
:::

## Step 3: Create Validator Key

Create validator key with go-x1. Take note of the validator public key; we will need it later. Enter a strong password when prompted.
::: tabs key:os

== Linux Service

```shell [Linux Service]
# Switch to the x1 user first.
# This is optional depending on your setup.
sudo su x1

x1 validator new
```

== MacOS Service

```shell [MacOS Service]
x1 validator new
```

== With Command Flags

```shell [With Command Flags]
x1 validator new
```
:::

## Step 4: Save the Validator Password

Place the Validator Password in a File.

```shell
echo "MY_STRONG_PASSWORD" > ~/.x1/.password
```

## Step 5: Navigate to the X1 Explorer

Navigate to the [SFC Contract](https://explorer.x1-testnet.xen.network/address/0xFC00FACE00000000000000000000000000000000/write-contract#address-tabs) on the explorer.

## Step 6: Connect Your Wallet

Click the "Connect wallet" button and connect to your validator wallet.

## Step 7: Enter Your Validator Public Key

Enter your validator public key from step 3 and the amount of XN you want to stake, then click "Write".

## Step 8: Confirm the Transaction

Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## Step 9: Verify Your Validator Registration

Verify your validator registration by searching for your validator ID on the [PWA explorer](https://pwa-explorer.x1-testnet.xen.network/staking) using your wallet account.
Make note of the validation ID.

## Step 10: Edit the config file and update the Validator ID, public key, and password file path.

::: tabs key:os
== Linux Service

```shell [Linux Service]
# Use the example config file for a validator node
cp /usr/local/share/x1/configs/testnet/validator-node.toml \
  /etc/x1/config.toml

# Edit the config file and update the Validator ID,
# public key, and password file's path.
# (Use your favorite text editor)
nano /etc/x1/config.toml

# Restart the node
sudo systemctl restart x1.service

# check the logs for any errors
journalctl -t x1 -f
```

== MacOS Service

```shell [MacOS Service]
# Use the example config file for a validator node
cp $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/usr/local/share/x1/configs/testnet/validator-node.toml \
  $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/x1/config.toml

# Edit the config file and update the Validator ID,
# public key, and password file's path.
# (Use your favorite text editor)
nano $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/x1/config.toml

# Restart the node
brew services restart x1

# check the logs for any errors
tail -f /opt/homebrew/var/log/x1.log
```

== With Command Flags

```shell [With Command Flags]
# Example command line flags for a validator node.
# Replace `YOUR_VALIDATOR_ID` with your validator ID and
# `YOUR_VALIDATOR_PUBKEY` with your validator's public key.
x1 --testnet \
   --syncmode snap \
   --validator.id YOUR_VALIDATOR_ID \
   --validator.pubkey YOUR_VALIDATOR_PUBKEY \
   --validator.password ~/.x1/.password
```

::: tip ðŸŽ‰ Awesome!
You're now running an X1 validator node! Make sure to keep your node up and running.
